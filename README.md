##Bot Help

Bot comes up with a four-digit number.
User enters a presumptive number and then receives in response the number of cows and the number of bulls.
(You also need to enter a number from different digits).
* **BULL**: this is a number that is present both in the user number and in the intended number and occupies the same position (order in number).
For example, in numbers 1325 and 9823, the number two is a bull.
* **COW**: This is a number that is present in both numbers but occupies different positions.
